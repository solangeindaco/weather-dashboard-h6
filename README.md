# Weather Dashboard

## Description

I developed from scratch a Weather Dashboard as part of a homework for a Coding Bootcamp, to learn how to use Third party APIs.
I learn:     
    - how to use Momentjs library to display the dates.          
    - how to use OpenWeatherMap API.     
    - how to use Geocoding API to obtain the coordinates of a city   
    - how to make a request to an API.      
    - how to use Bootstrap to style the web page.
